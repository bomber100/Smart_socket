## Usage
TTL Interface RS232 Data output format 
1. 9600bps,N,8,1
2. CHECKSUM: card 10byte DATA entire do XOR operation 

-- | - | - | - 
-- | -- | -- | -- 
02 | 10ASCII Data Characters | Chechsum | 03

Example: card number: 62E3086CED

Output data:36H 32H 45H 33H 30H 38H 36H 43H 45H 44H 

CHECKSUM: (62H) XOR (E3H) XOR (08H) XOR (6CH) XOR (EDH)=08H



Here's a walkthrough of how to calculate the checksum.

Take your card number (this is just directly quoted from your text)

`2 - 51 - 67 - 48 - 48 - 67 - 69 - 55 - 53 - 52 - 67 - 67 - 66 - 3`

This would give you a number that is equivalent to the following:

`2 51 67 48 48 67 69 55 53 52 67 67 66 3`

The first numer (2) indicates that this is the beginning of a request.

The last number (3) indicates that this is the end of a request.

**2** `51 67 48 48 67 69 55 53 52 67 67 66` **3**

For the purposes of calculating the checksum, we are going to remove these two numbers. So your new number is now:

`51 67 48 48 67 69 55 53 52 67 67 66`

The last two numbers that you have are your checksum. The remaining numbers are your card number. So:

Your card number is:

`51 67 48 48 67 69 55 53 52 67`

And your checksum is:

`67 66`

Next you need to convert your Card Number and your Checksum to ASCII values:

Your card number is:

`3 C 0 0 C E 7 5 4 C`

And your checksum is:

`C B`

Next, grab each number into pairs:

Your card number is:

`3C 00 CE 75 4C`

And your checksum is:

`CB`

Then you need to treat each pair as a HEXIDECIMAL value and do an XOR against them. So basically you need to prove the following:

`3C ^ 00 ^ CE ^ 75 ^ 4C == CB`

`(3C ^ 00) = 3C`

`3C ^ CE ^ 75 ^ 4C == CB`

`(3C ^ CE) = F2`

`F2 ^ 75 ^ 4C == CB`

`(3C ^ CE) = 87`

`87 ^ 4C == CB`

`(87 ^ 4C) = CB`

`CB == CB`

Because CB == CB, this is a valid transaction.
